        <p><h4>How I got into soccer</h4>
            <h5>I first got into soccer because of my parents, who got me into the sport at the age of around 2 or 3. I had never really started watching every weekend until the past few years, although I had watched infrequently before. I had decided to take a break from the sport when I was 15 and I have debated returning ever since. I had always thought that it was fun and I only stopped playing because of health reasons, which I think should be resolved by now. After I took a break from soccer, I had begun getting really into watching the sport and gaining a deeper understanding of the game, along with watching weekly and participating in fantasy leagues.

        <p><h4>How I got into reading</h4>
        <h5>I used to hate reading because I thought that it was boring and hard to get into, as a result, I ended up avoiding reading for a large part of my early-middle childhood aside from a few series that had caught my eye. Later on though, I decided to give it another chance and I found that it was much easier for me to immerse myself into a book once I had found a good one and I had begun enjoying books a lot more.</h5></p>

        <p><h4>mmm, I like food..</h4>
        <h5>I like food alot it tastes good mmm.. taste delicious.. I have no allergies and I only dislike food like brussel sprouts and asparagius. other than that I like all food. I would say that my favorite types of food are fruits, meats, and grains like rice and pasta, also bread is so good. Dragon fruit tastes kind of like nothing to me which I don't really mind, I just think that its a little weird. My favorite rice is white rice by a lot its so good. If I had to say a favorite bread.. I would say all of them because they all tastes good.</h5></p>
